For setting up each of option you should set some option in the tor config file.

	For running the code as pure vanilla tor with no modification:
	VANILLA 1
	For running the code as CAR (congestion-aware routing):
	VANILLA 2
	For evaluating different stream attachment schemes:
	VANILLA 3
	For running the code as all-in-one:
	VANILLA 0


VANILLA == 0 needs more configurations.
